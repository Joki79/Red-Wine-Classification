# Red-Wine-Classification
"The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones)." (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) 


In this repository I will tackle the question of outliers, feature importance and regression models. I will try my moels on two data sets. 

The first dataset will have the original "quality" column with classes from 3-8. 

The second dataset will have adapted "quality" column with categories "average" and "good". 

Classification models performace will be evaluated using precision-recal score (in the first case especially) and roc-auc score(in the secodn case because I will have more balanced data).
